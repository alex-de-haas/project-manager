# Drops from root to an unprivileged user before starting the server.
#
# The uid is NOT fixed to the image's `node` user. Hosty Core bind-mounts the app data directory from
# its own apps/<id>/data tree on the host, owned by the user running Core — which is not root: `hosty`
# installs under $HOME and Core binds only unprivileged ports. Chowning that tree to the image's uid
# would take it away from Core on any host whose Core uid is not 1000, and Core's uninstall path
# swallows the resulting UnauthorizedAccessException, so "remove app with data" would report success
# while leaving the data on disk. Backups read the same tree.
#
# So: adopt the mount's existing owner rather than rewriting it. Ownership is only ever assigned when
# the directory is root-owned — a fresh volume, or a Core that genuinely runs as root — and root keeps
# full access to node-owned files either way. This keeps SQLite writes working however the /app/data
# mount was provisioned.
